  "readme": "# Tern\n\nThis is [Tern][1]. Tern is a stand-alone, editor-independant\nJavaScript analyzer that can be used to improve the JavaScript\nintegration of existing editors. It currently comes only with an\n[online demo][1], but I am hard at work on Emacs and Vim plug-ins.\n\nThanks to a group of generous [crowd funders][2], Tern is open-source\nsoftware, under an MIT license.\n\n[1]: http://ternjs.net\n[2]: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tern-intelligent-javascript-editing\n\n## Setting up the Emacs mode\n\n(Disclaimer: This is a work in progress. The interface will change,\nand it has bugs. But it just might occasionally work.)\n\n 1. Make sure you are using Emacs 24 or later. The Tern mode requires\n    lexical scoping.\n\n 1. Clone this repository somewhere. Do `npm install` to get the\n    dependencies.\n\n 1. Make Emacs aware of `emacs/tern.el`. For example by adding this to\n    your `.emacs` file:\n\n        (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/tern/emacs/\")\n        (autoload 'tern-mode \"tern.el\" nil t)\n\n 1. Optionally set `tern-mode` to be automatically enabled for your\n    JavaScript mode of choice. Here's the snippet for `js-mode`:\n\n        (add-hook 'js-mode-hook (lambda () (tern-mode t)))\n\nBuffers in `tern-mode` add a `completion-at-point` function that\nactivates Tern's completion. So, unless you rebound the command,\n`M-tab` will trigger completion.\n\nWhen the point is in an argument list, Tern will show argument names\nand types at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe following keys are bound:\n\n * `M-.` to jump to the definition of the thing under the cursor.\n * `M-,` brings you back to last place you were when you pressed `M-.`.\n * `C-c C-r` to rename the variable under the cursor.\n",
