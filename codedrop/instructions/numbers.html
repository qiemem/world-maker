<h1>Numbers</h1>
While you can string multiple <code>.forward(1.0)</code>s together to move objects different distances, this doesn't give you very fine grained control.
<br/>
Enter <code>hand.forward(1.0)</code>.
<br/>
Mouse over the <code>1.0</code>. Notice how it highlights a little and a circle appears on the left side of it.
<br/>
You can click and drag this circle to increase or decrease the number! Try it now and see what happens to the hand. This lets you quickly try out a whole range of numbers to get exactly what you want.
