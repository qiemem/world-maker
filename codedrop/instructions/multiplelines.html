<h1>Multiple Lines</h1>
In order to make more complicated things happen in a scene, you need to write multiple statements.
<br/>
Try entering <b><code>hand.forward(1.0)</code></b>. To say that this is a complete statement, add a <b><code>;</code></b> at the end and press enter.
<br/>
Then enter <b><code>hand.cube();</code></b>. The hand has created a cube in its new position!
<br/>
Mouse over one of the lines that you wrote. Notice how the line get highlighted a little bit and a little circle appears on the left side. To quickly rearrange the lines, you can click and drag this circle to a new position. Try it now!
<br/>
By the way, the editor part of the programming environment works just like a normal text editor. So, you can type and delete, copy and paste, undo and redo just like normal!
