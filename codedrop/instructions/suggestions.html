<h1>Suggestions</h1>
The top of the programming environment is a text editor where you will enter your code.
<br/>
The bottom is a list of suggestions of what you can try entering.
<br/>
Put your mouse over <b>'hand'</b>. Notice how 'hand' appears in the text editor. Mouse off of it again. Notice how it disappears.
<br/>
Now click <b>'hand'</b>. Notice how it has now been inserted into the text.
<br/>
The list of suggestions has changed! It now says '.cube()' in addition to 'hand'.
<br/>
'hand' was a way of talking about the hand. The '.' is a way of saying "I'm going to tell this thing to do something". So 'hand.cube()' is saying "hand! Make a cube!".
<br/>
Mouse over '.cube()'. Again it's been inserted into the editor. But the hand has also created a cube!
<br/>
Click on '.cube()' to insert it for good. See how the marbles are rolling off it and hitting the goal? You should win in a few seconds!
